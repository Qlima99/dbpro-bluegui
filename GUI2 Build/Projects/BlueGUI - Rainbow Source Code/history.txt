*Notes about the Item Editor*

- Due to a DarkBASIC Pro bug with WRITE STRING, it is not possible to save gadgets which have a large number of items.  You
can however export .dba code for layouts containing gadgets that have a large number of items. 

If Rainbow encounters problems when saving a gadget's details to the .gui file, it will display a message warning the user and
continue saving the other gadgets.
