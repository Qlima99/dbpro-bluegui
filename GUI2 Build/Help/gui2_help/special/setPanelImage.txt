You must also ensure that you have a memblock command somewhere else in your program.  This does not need to be in any code which is ever run, but it just needs to be there in your source so that the compiler builds the memblock commands into the program.  }Param3{fileName}Param3Desc{Alternatively, you can specify the filename of a bitmap (BMP) file and that will be loaded instead.  The pixel in the top-left hand corner of the image will be used as a transparent colour.}
