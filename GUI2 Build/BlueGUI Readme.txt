BlueGUI version 2.0 Readme - Robert Knight 2005
===============================================

Thank-you for buying BlueGUI version 2.0 for DarkBASIC Professional.

Getting Started
===============

To access BlueGUI help & tutorials, go to [Start Menu] > BlueGUI 2 > BlueGUI Help

- Read the "Introduction to BlueGUI 2.0" for an overview of how to get started with the plugin, including designing menus 
and using Rainbow.

- Have a look at the Examples folder for demonstrations showing how to use the main types of gadgets.  The examples folder
is called "BlueGUI Examples" and can be found in the default DarkBASIC Pro projects directory (Usually C:\Program Files\
Dark Basic Software\Dark Basic Professional\Projects)

- Once you are familiar with the plugin, you can have a look at the source code for Rainbow.

Command Reference
=================

The Command Reference provides a complete list of all the commands in the plugin and help using them.
You can access command help easily from either the normal DBPro editor or BlueIDE by typing in the name of the command in the code 
edit area (so that it is highlighted in blue) and pressing the F1 key.

XP Themes, gui.dba & Web Browser Gadget DLL
==================================

- In order to use Windows XP themes in your application, you will need to put a special "manifest" file in the same folder as your
application.  This file is called "myapp.exe.manifest" and is available in the "BlueGUI Extras" folder inside the main DBPro installation folder.
After copying the file, rename it to whatever your program is called, eg if your program is "racing_game.exe" then your
manifest file should be called "racing_game.exe.manifest" 

- In order to use Web Browser gadgets in your program, copy the gui2_web.dll file from the "BlueGUI Extras" folder (inside the main
DBPro install folder) into the same folder as your application.

- gui.dba contains useful constants (putting names to numbers - eg: BORDER_NONE = 0).  This can be found in any of the example
project folders.
